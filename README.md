# Question Trivia Project

For this project i made a series of questions for the user to answer.
I made a trivia porject that consists of basic questions and uses javascript to be interactive ti the user.
The javascript file was added with functions to start the quiz, start the timer , and to keep track of the users score.
When the series of 10 questions are complete the game ends and records the users score for the game.
